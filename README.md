# WeOptimize.ai Assurance & Promptfoo Framework

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive framework for AI assurance, prompt engineering, and red teaming using Promptfoo and WeOptimize.ai. It is designed to evaluate, test, and report on the safety, reliability, and compliance of large language models (LLMs).

## Features
- Red teaming for prompt injection and jailbreak scenarios
- Configurable prompt testing and assertions
- Compliance mapping and threat modeling
- Automated reporting (PDF/HTML)
- Secure API key and environment management

## Technologies
- Python, Shell scripting
- YAML, JSON
- Promptfoo
- Automated reporting tools

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Obtain a valid WeOptimize API key (not publicly accessible; request from project owner)
3. Add your API keys to the `.env` file
4. Run test scripts in the `WeOptimize.ai_test_framework` directory
5. Review generated reports (e.g., BaselineReport_WeOptimize_ai_promptfoo.pdf)

## Example Outputs
- Baseline and advanced test reports
- Compliance and threat model documentation
- Prompt assertion results

## Folder Highlights
- `WeOptimize.ai_test_framework/` – Main framework, configs, and reports
