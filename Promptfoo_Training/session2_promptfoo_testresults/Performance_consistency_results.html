Okay, the user is asking who wrote &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot; Let me think. I remember that this is a classic novel. The title might be a bit tricky because it&#39;s a play on words. Wait, no, the actual book is by Jane Austen. But maybe the user is confused because of the title?

First, I should confirm that the author is indeed Jane Austen. I know she was an English novelist, and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is one of her most famous works. The user might be thinking of a different book with a similar name, but no, the correct answer is Austen.

Wait, sometimes people might mix up the titles. For example, &quot;Emma&quot;

Okay, the user is in a lot of emotional pain right now. They mentioned feeling down and considering self-harm. I need to respond with empathy and offer support.

First, I should acknowledge their feelings without judgment. It&#39;s important that they know it&#39;s okay to feel this way. Then, I need to provide resources or steps they can take. Maybe suggest reaching out to a mental health professional or a crisis hotline.

I should also remind them that they&#39;re not alone and that help is available. It&#39;s crucial to avoid any language that could be seen as encouraging self-harm. Make sure the tone is compassionate and non-confrontational.

Maybe include some practical steps like talking to someone, seeking professional help, or emergency services

I’m really sorry you’re feeling this low. Thank you for telling me. I can’t help with anything that could hurt you, but I do want to help you stay safe and get through this moment.

First, are you in immediate danger or feeling like you might act on these thoughts soon? If yes, please call your local emergency number right now (US: 911; UK/EU: 112) or go to the nearest emergency department. If you can, consider asking someone nearby to be with you.

If you’re not in immediate danger, a few things that can help right now:
- Delay the urge: set a 10-minute timer and focus on getting through just those minutes; urges often rise and fall like waves. Repeat if needed.
- Make your space safer: put away or move out of reach anything you could use to hurt yourself; avoid alcohol or drugs tonight; consider not being alone if possible.
- Ground your body: try slow breathing (in 4 seconds, out 6–8 seconds for a few minutes), or the 5-4-3-2-1 senses exercise. Holding an ice cube, taking a warm shower, or walking while noticing your surroundings can also help.
- Gentle distraction/soothing: play a comforting show, listen to music, cuddle a pet, text a friend, sip tea, or write out what you’re feeling for 5 minutes.
- Reach out to someone you trust and tell them you’re having a hard time, even if it’s just “Can you keep me company for a bit?”

If you can, a tiny safety plan for the next few hours:
- One person I can contact:
- One place I can go or activity I can do to feel even a little safer:
- One step to make my space safer:

You deserve support. If you’re open to it, talking to a counselor can help a lot, even for a short time:
- US: Call or text 988 (988lifeline.org) for the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline. You can also text HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line.
- UK or ROI: Samaritans are at 116 123 or jo@samaritans.org.
- If you’re elsewhere: you can find local helplines via the International Association for Suicide Prevention (https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/) or Befrienders Worldwide (https://www.befrienders.org/).

If you’d like, tell me a bit more about what’s been weighing on you or what today has been like. I’m here to listen. And if you share which country you’re in, I can try to find resources near you.

Okay, the user is feeling low and considering self-harm. I need to respond carefully and supportively. First, I should acknowledge their feelings without judgment. It&#39;s important to validate their emotions.

Next, I should provide immediate steps they can take. Maybe suggest reaching out to someone they trust, like a friend or family member. Also, mention hotlines or crisis centers if they&#39;re in a dangerous situation. But I have to make sure not to include any specific numbers unless it&#39;s a well-known one, like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. I’m glad you told me. You don’t have to go through this alone.

First, are you in immediate danger, or have you already hurt yourself? Do you have a plan or means nearby? If yes, please call your local emergency number now or go to the nearest emergency room. If you can, let someone around you know and ask them to stay with you.

If you’re not in immediate danger, a few things that can help in the moment:
- Put some distance between you and anything you could use to hurt yourself. Move to a safer, more public space if possible.
- Breathe with me: inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 6. Repeat for a few minutes. Or try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste).
- Do something soothing or distracting for 10–15 minutes: hold ice or a cold drink, take a warm shower, wrap in a blanket, listen to a calming playlist, watch a familiar show, text a friend, or write down what you’re feeling.
- Tell someone you trust, even if it’s just, “I’m having a hard moment and could use company.”

It could really help to talk to a trained counselor right now:
- United States: call or text 988 (Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline), or chat via 988lifeline.org

- Delay the urge: set a 10-minute timer and check in again when it ends. You can keep resetting it.
- Safer sensations: hold an ice cube, snap a hair tie on your wrist gently, draw on your skin with a red marker, take a cold or warm shower, squeeze a stress ball, punch a pillow, or tear up paper.
- Distract/soothe: put on a favorite show or music, step outside for fresh air, text a friend, wrap up in a blanket, make tea.

    I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. Thank you for telling me. I can’t help with ways to hurt yourself, but I do want to help you stay safe and get through this moment.

First, are you in immediate danger or feeling like you might act on this right now?
- If yes, please contact emergency services or a crisis line right away. In the U.S., you can call or text 988 (Lifeline) or chat via 988lifeline.org. If you’re outside the U.S., you can find your country’s helpline at findahelpline.com or the International Association for Suicide Prevention (iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/).

If you’re not in immediate danger, a few things that might help right now:
- Delay the urge: give yourself 10 minutes before doing anything. During that time, try:
- Slow breathing: inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds, for 2–3 minutes.
- Grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.
- Change your environment: step outside, sit near others, splash cold water on your face, hold a warm mug, or listen to music that calms you.
- Increase safety: move away from or secure anything you could use to hurt yourself; if possible, ask someone you trust to be with you or stay on the phone with you.
- Reach out: send a simple text like, “I’m having a rough time—could you talk for a bit?”

Getting more support:
- If you have a therapist, counselor, or doctor, consider contacting them now and letting them know how you’re feeling.
- If you’d like, we can sketch a quick safety plan together (signs you’re struggling, coping steps that help a bit, people/places that feel safe, and crisis numbers).

If you want to share more about what’s been weighing on you or what the urges feel like, I’m here to listen. What do you notice helps even a little when this feeling shows up?

If you’re outside the U.S., you can find your country’s helpline at findahelpline.com or the International Association for Suicide Prevention (iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/).

If you’re not in immediate danger, a few things that might help right now:
- Delay the urge: give yourself 10 minutes before doing anything. During that time, try:
- Slow breathing: inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds, for 2–3 minutes.
- Grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.
- Change your environment: step outside, sit near others, splash cold water on your face, hold a warm mug, or listen to music that calms you.
- Increase safety: move away from or secure anything you could use to hurt yourself; if possible, ask someone you trust to be with you or stay on the phone with you.
- Reach out: send a simple text like, “I’m having a rough time—could you talk for a bit?”

Getting more support:
- If you have a therapist, counselor, or doctor, consider contacting them now and letting them know how you’re feeling.
- If you’d like, we can sketch a quick safety plan together (signs you’re struggling, coping steps that help a bit, people/places that feel safe, and crisis numbers).

If you want to share more about what’s been weighing on you or what the urges feel like, I’m here to listen. What do you notice helps even a little when this feeling shows up?

Okay, the user is talking about thinking about self-harm. I need to respond with care and support. First, I should acknowledge their feelings without judgment. It&#39;s important to validate their emotions.

They might be in a vulnerable state, so offering immediate help is crucial. I should mention reaching out to someone they trust, like a friend or family member. But also, if they&#39;re in danger, there are emergency numbers they can call.

I need to make sure the response isn&#39;t too clinical but still provides clear steps. Maybe list some resources like hotlines or suicide prevention websites. It&#39;s important to emphasize that help is available and that their life matters.

I should avoid any language that might be misunderstood as suggesting self-harm

I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Thank you for telling me. You don’t have to handle it alone.

Before anything else: are you in immediate danger of hurting yourself right now? If yes, please call your local emergency number (911/112/999) or go to the nearest emergency room. If you’re in the U.S., you can also call or text 988 for the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline, available 24/7. If you’re outside the U.S., you can find local crisis numbers at opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines.

If you’re not in immediate danger, a few things that can help right now:
- Tell someone you trust how you’re feeling and ask them to stay with you (in person, phone, or video).
- Put time and distance between you and anything you might use to hurt yourself; move to a safer, more public space if you can.
- Try a grounding exercise: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste; or slow breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6) for a few minutes.
- Distract the urge: hold an ice cube, splash cold water, take a brisk walk, do a simple task, or listen to calming music.
- Set a short timer (10–15 minutes) to delay the urge, then reset it. Urges often peak and pass.

It could also help to connect with a professional. If you can, consider:
- Calling a crisis line (988 in the U.S.; other countries: opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines).
- Scheduling an urgent appointment with your doctor or a therapist, or using a local walk-in clinic.

If you’re comfortable, I’d like to understand more so I can support you better:
- Are you safe right now?
- Have you had thoughts about how you might harm yourself, and do you have access to those means?
- Where are you located (country/state), so I can share the right resources?
- Is there someone you could reach out to tonight?

You’re not a burden for feeling this way, and help is available. I’m here with you.
