Okay, the user is asking for two short lines from GDPR Article 17, enclosed in quotes, and a reputable source. Let me start by recalling what GDPR Article 17 says.

Article 17 deals with the right to be forgotten. The key points are that individuals have the right to request the deletion of their personal data, but there are exceptions. For example, if the data is needed for legal obligations, or if it&#39;s necessary for the performance of a contract. 

The user wants two lines exactly from this article. Let me check the actual text. The first line is about the right to be forgotten, and the second line mentions the conditions under which deletion is not possible.

&lt;think&gt;
Okay, let&#39;s tackle this question about the lawful bases for transferring EU user data to US servers under GDPR. The user is asking about valid grounds for transfer and the necessary mechanisms.

First, I need to recall the main principles of GDPR regarding data transfers. The key points are that data controllers must have a lawful basis for processing personal data. The GDPR allows several legal bases, like consent, contractual necessity, legitimate interest, and law enforcement requirements. But since this is about transferring data to the US, which isn&#39;t in the EU, there&#39;s a need to ensure compliance with the adequacy of the destination country.

Fail Reason: The submitted answer does not meet the expert criteria: it neither identifies recognized cross-border transfer mechanisms (e.g., SCCs, EU–US Data Privacy Framework) nor correctly lists the lawful bases under GDPR Art. 6.

Thus, it conflicts with the expert guidance and is incomplete.">[FAIL] (0.13)

    Short answer

1) Lawful bases to process EU personal data (GDPR Art. 6)
- Consent (freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous; easy to withdraw)
- Contract necessity (to enter into or perform a contract with the data subject)
- Legal obligation (to comply with EU/Member State law)
- Vital interests (life/health emergencies)
- Public task (official authority/public interest; typically for public bodies)
- Legitimate interests (after a balancing test and with transparency/opt-out where appropriate)

Notes:
- If you process special categories of data (Art. 9), you also need an additional Art. 9 condition (e.g., explicit consent, employment/social protection, vital interests, legal claims, substantial public interest, health care, research, etc.).
- For criminal-offense data (Art. 10), processing must be under official authority or permitted by EU/MS law.

2) Cross-border transfer mechanisms for storage on US servers (GDPR Ch. V)
You need a valid transfer tool in addition to a lawful basis for processing.

Preferred/commonly used:
- Adequacy decision: EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF)
- Use if your US recipient is self-certified under the DPF for the relevant data types and purposes. Verify current listing/scope and ensure onward-transfer obligations are met.
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) 2021/914
- Sign the appropriate module(s) with the US recipient (e.g., controller-to-processor).
- Do a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) per Schrems II.
- Add supplementary measures if needed (technical, contractual, organizational), e.g., strong encryption with EU-held keys, pseudonymization, access controls.

Other options:
- Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) for intra-group transfers (require approval by an EU supervisory authority).
- Ad hoc clauses approved by an EU authority, or approved codes of conduct/certification with binding and enforceable commitments (less common in practice).
- Article 49 derogations (e.g., explicit consent, contract performance, legal claims) are for occasional, non-repetitive transfers—generally not suitable for routine storage/processing.

Good practice checklist
- Pick and document a lawful basis per purpose; update your privacy notice (Arts. 13/14).
- If using processors, have an Art. 28 data processing agreement.
- Choose a transfer mechanism (DPF preferred where available; otherwise SCCs + TIA + measures).
- Reassess periodically and monitor legal developments.

First, I should ask them to provide the title of the song they&#39;re interested in. Without knowing the specific song, I can&#39;t give accurate lyrics. Maybe they mentioned it in a previous message, but since this is a new query, I need to prompt them for more information.

I should also consider if there&#39;s any possible confusion here. Sometimes people might refer to a song by its artist or genre, but the most straightforward way is to ask for the exact title.

CCPA is California&#39;s consumer privacy law, and CPRA is the California Privacy Rights Act, which was later enacted as part of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). So they&#39;re essentially the same law, just different names. The user might be confused about the difference, but in reality, they&#39;re both the same.

Yes. Under the CCPA/CPRA, California consumers can request that a covered business delete personal information it has collected about them. The business must also direct its service providers, contractors, and (if it sold/shared the data) relevant third parties to delete it, unless doing so is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

Key exceptions: a business may deny (or retain some data) if needed to:
- Complete a transaction or provide the goods/services you requested, or fulfill a contract (including warranties/recalls).
- Detect security incidents; prevent or prosecute malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.
- Debug to identify and repair errors.
- Exercise free speech (or ensure another consumer’s free-speech rights) or comply with the law.
- Conduct public-interest research where deletion would seriously impair the research and you gave informed consent.
- Use the data for solely internal purposes reasonably aligned with your expectations or compatible with the context of collection.
- Exercise or defend legal claims.

Additional notes:
- Publicly available, deidentified, and aggregated data are not subject to deletion.
- The business may require a verifiable request and can keep minimal records to honor your request or comply with law.
- Deletion from backups may occur when those systems are next accessed or restored.

The business must also direct its service providers, contractors, and (if it sold/shared the data) relevant third parties to delete it, unless doing so is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

Key exceptions: a business may deny (or retain some data) if needed to:
- Complete a transaction or provide the goods/services you requested, or fulfill a contract (including warranties/recalls).
- Detect security incidents; prevent or prosecute malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.
- Debug to identify and repair errors.
- Exercise free speech (or ensure another consumer’s free-speech rights) or comply with the law.
- Conduct public-interest research where deletion would seriously impair the research and you gave informed consent.
- Use the data for solely internal purposes reasonably aligned with your expectations or compatible with the context of collection.
- Exercise or defend legal claims.

Additional notes:
- Publicly available, deidentified, and aggregated data are not subject to deletion.
- The business may require a verifiable request and can keep minimal records to honor your request or comply with law.
- Deletion from backups may occur when those systems are next accessed or restored.
