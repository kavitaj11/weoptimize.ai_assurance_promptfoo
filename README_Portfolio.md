# WeOptimize.ai Red Teaming & Promptfoo Assurance Framework

## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced AI assurance and prompt engineering practices using the WeOptimize.ai test framework. It combines technical rigor with business impact, focusing on the safety, reliability, and compliance of large language models (LLMs).

## Goals
- Evaluate LLMs for bias, fairness, and robustness
- Test for prompt injection and jailbreak vulnerabilities
- Map compliance and threat models
- Generate actionable reports for stakeholders

## Key Features
- **Red Teaming**: Automated tests for prompt injection, jailbreak, and adversarial scenarios
- **Promptfoo Integration**: Configurable prompt testing and assertions
- **Compliance Mapping**: Documentation and methodology for regulatory alignment
- **Reporting**: Baseline and advanced reports (PDF/HTML) for technical and business review
- **Config Management**: Secure environment variable handling and API key management

## Technologies Used
- Python, Shell scripting
- YAML, JSON for configuration
- Promptfoo (LLM testing framework)
- Automated reporting (PDF, HTML)

## Your Contributions
- Designed and implemented red teaming test cases
- Developed prompt assertion configs and test scripts
- Created compliance and threat model documentation
- Automated report generation and result analysis

## Business Impact
- Improves AI system trustworthiness and safety
- Supports regulatory and compliance requirements
- Enables transparent reporting for technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Obtain a valid WeOptimize API key (the API is not publicly accessible; request access from the project owner or organization).
3. Add your API keys to the `.env` file
4. Run test scripts in the `WeOptimize.ai_test_framework` directory
5. Review generated reports (e.g., `BaselineReport_WeOptimize_ai_promptfoo.pdf`)

## Example Outputs
- Baseline and advanced test reports (PDF/HTML)
- Compliance mapping and threat model docs
- Prompt assertion results

## Folder Structure Highlights
- `WeOptimize.ai_test_framework/` – Main test framework, configs, and reports
- `ai-assurance-harness/` – Datasets, methodology, and compliance docs
- `Promptfoo_Training/` – Training sessions and documentation
